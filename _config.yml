          CLI application for finding the optimal solution in traveling salesman problem. Metaheuristic methods supported: hill-climbing, simulated annealing, and random search. Solvers can be run in parallel utilizing all CPU cores for multiple runs as it's one of the methods for finding optimal solutions because solvers often get stuck in local optima.

            As a software developer, I was creating proof of concept for utilizing blockchain technology in retail sales in the cannabis industry. Due to the characteristics of sold gods transparency and traceability were required. The system was designed to communicate mostly in an asynchronous manner with CQRS and event sourcing. The crucial part of the system was built as a smart contract on the EOS blockchain. My daily tasks included developing and testing new features, research and brainstorming.

            As a software developer, my role was to develop, test, and deliver new features to the existing system and build systems from the scratch. My daily tasks included also business requirements analysys, cost and risk estimation, mentoring. During this period I built systems that consumed messages in both synchronous and asynchronous manner. I created REST and SOAP endpoints with backward compatibility in mind. Communication involved also integration with RabbitMQ as message broker. Delivered solutions digitalized point of sales  and call centers sales processes. Time for call center contact was dropped from minutes to seconds.
